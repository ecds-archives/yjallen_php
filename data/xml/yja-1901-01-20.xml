            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

My dear <persName>George</persName>,</salute></opener> 
            <p>I am not due you a letter but write because I feel moved to do so. Your recent article in one of the papers, about our old friend R. W. <unclear resp="#JC" cert="high"  reason="illegible">Bigham</unclear>, I think it was, deeply stirred my heart-memories.  There was a vein of sadness in it that chimed in with my own <hi rend="underline">latent</hi> feelings, unfrequently touched with a feeling akin to melancholy and a sense of isolation and loneliness--<hi rend="underline">I am so far away</hi> from the few old friends who are left, and there is sometimes such a heart hunger for love and sympathy, that life in China but for the faith and hope which <choice><sic>surive,</sic><corr>survive</corr></choice> and dominate all, would be almost insupportable.  Faith to me is truly the evidence of things not seen, the substance of things hoped for, and so I dare not relax my grasp on this mountain (of Chinese paganism) but feel sure it shall be in due time plucked up and cast into the sea.  I am waiting anxiously for your usual Conference letter.  May God bless you more and more my dear old friend and comfort you with the assurances of much love from your old friends, among whom count me always. </p>
