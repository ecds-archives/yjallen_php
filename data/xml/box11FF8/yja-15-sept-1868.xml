                <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF images of each page
                    using either a flatbed scanner. Text pages were captured in color at 400dpi.
                    These digital images were converted to an electronic text file by transcription.
                    The text files produced have been proofread against the original document or a
                    JPEG image of the original. This proofread text file has then been encoded using

                <p>Persecution seems to be the order of the day just now in China and Japan. The
                    churches are extending into the far interior, and our influence is being felt:
                    and just in proportion to the progress we make, the more and fiercer opposition
                    we meet. The heathen are always ready to rage, and the people are never
                    satisfied with imagining a vain thing.</p>
                <p>Recently, at three different stations, two in the interior and one on the island
                    of Formosa, near Amoy, quite threatening disturbances have taken place,
                    resulting in the maltreatment of both foreigners <add place="supralinear"
                        >and</add> native Christians, the destruction of private houses, preaching
                    places and considerable property pertaining thereto. Fortunately, the places are
                    accessible to foreign consuls, and they are more disposed than formerly to see
                    that the several articles of the treaties relating to toleration shall be
                    efficiently adhered to. It seems that the literati -- otherwise called "gentry"
                    -- have in nearly every instance instigated such attempts to expel foreigners
                    and their teaching. How flimsy and false their pretexts for such onsloughts, you
                    may judge by the following just brought to light by the Yang Chow outrage.</p>
                <p>Mr. Taylor, an English missionary, together with several others, among them three
                    or four women, had just commenced their labors at that city. They had opened a
                    school, and he (Mr. T.), being a physician, was charitably dispensing his
                    medicines, etc. It was not long, however, before the mob attacked their
                    premises, destroyed their house, compelling the women to leap from the second
                    <pb facs="Allen_11_ff8_025.jpg"/> story of the house, and all to make their
                    escape from the city as best they could. Several of them were wounded, and one
                    young man had an eye knocked out. The reasons assigned for this strange
                    proceeding were that Mr. T. was dispensing medicines which <hi rend="underline"
                        >confused</hi> the minds of the people, changed their likeness, if not their
                    hearts, and was the means of inducing them to join the church and become
                    foreigners; and further that since the opening of the school eight or ten young
                    children had disappeared in the community, and must have been <hi
                        rend="underline">eaten</hi> by the missionaries. They further alleged that
                    foreigners plucked out the eyes of the dead for some unknown purpose -- and
                    report says that many corpses have just been exhumed to satisfy those interested
                    as to the pro or con of that assertion.</p>
                <p>It seems that the attack on the missionaries and native Christians in Formosa
                    originated from similar stories. I have heard them myself at Shanghai, and in
                    the country at one of my preaching places, distant about twenty miles. I had an
                    interesting attendance dispersed by a young man who came in my absence and sowed
                    the seeds of consternation in their minds. Verily, darkness covers the land, and
                    gross darkness the people. It is by means of the two newspapers that I am now
                    conducting that I hope to do most toward opening the eyes of the people to the
                    truth, and shedding upon them a knowledge of that true Light which enlighteneth
                    the world. More anon.</p>
