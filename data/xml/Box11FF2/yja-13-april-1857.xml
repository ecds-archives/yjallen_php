    <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF images of each page using either
     a flatbed scanner. Text pages were captured in color at 400dpi. These digital images were
     converted to an electronic text file by transcription. The text files produced have been
     proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of the original. This proofread text
     file has then been encoded using the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries
     Guidelines. For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI Guidelines for
     Best Encoding practices at http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/. Encoders silently replaced em
     dashes with two dashes. Page numbers and other text such as titles displayed in brackets have
     been added by the encoder and do not appear in the original text.</p>

     <salute><hi rend="underline">My own Dearest Mollie</hi>,</salute>
    </opener>
    <p><hi rend="underline">I do thank God, and praise God</hi>, that he hath dealt so kindly, so
     mercifully, and so graciously with our souls. Yes, <hi rend="underline">My Own Mollie, I do
      bless God</hi> that in his Providence I ever knew <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. Tis the work
     of the Lord, <del rend="strikethrough">and</del> that brought us together and <hi
      rend="underline">Glory be to God</hi>, I know tis his Spirit that is leading us on. My
    Dear Mollie, your letter overcame me I was so glad.-- I went away, far away into a thick wood
    and there praised and blessed God and thanked him that he had heard our prayers and blessed our
    souls with the fulness of his love and with the joy and of a full Salvation, of an entire and
    accepted consecration, yes of an entire Sanctification of soul and all its powers, of body,
    time, talents and all our substance and all our interests in the world.-- And just about the time I
    got your letter, I believe on the very same day, I found out that another one of my friends here
    had gained the triumph-- And oh! Glory be to God, Mollie, I have been full all the week, I could
    scarcely talk, tears of joy would rush and fill my eyes all the times, and choke my utterance. I
    had to stay in my room and rejoice and my happy, dear friends would visit me once and awhile and
    such glorious times this earth never affords to poor sinners-- And my Mollie</p><p>At class meeting on
    Friday night the good Spirit and all its sweet and heavenly influences were there-- Our leader
    called on me to close by prayer after the exercises were over- and in the act of praying the
    power of the Spirit seemed to rest upon my soul and almost overcome me, (this poor soul)- so
    that I went away rejoicing and from that time till now I have been scarcely able to do anything,
    my mind would be so abstracted.--</p><p>I set down on Saturday evening to answer your letter, but before
    I wrote half a page, my soul became so full and overwhelmed that I had to stop,-- I could not
    write-- I feel the same good Spirit this morning and would delight to write you a full answer to
    your letter but I cannot as I have but a very few minutes this morning and I know not when I
    ever will have time again-- as I Just hastily drop you these lines to tell you My Dearest,
    precious Mollie, that I know not when I can write you a full answer, for I have so much to do
    now I can scarcely turn round.-- I want you to write me a long letter in answer to this if it is
    but a note, and tell me some more of your experience and how you have enjoyed yourself since
    that happy triumphing hour when "faith lent its realizing light"-- Dont be ashamed, nor afraid to
    confess what the Lord has done for you My Beloved Mollie no, no, that is, to those who ought to
    know.</p><p>Be sure and read the Riches of Grace as I asked you Mollie, in connection with your
    present experience it will confirm and establish your heart in its present height of joy and
    love-- We sent on for 5 more copies of it here, all the boys are so anxious to read it.</p><p>Speak to
    Miss Nellie on the subject, if you think it will be prudent, or any other of your friends that
    are anxious for a growth in grace and get them enlisted with you and endeavor, My Dearest, to
    awaken a deep concern on the subject there as there is now with us.-- Oh! the good, the glory which
    may thus be accomplished.--</p><p>Be sure [an] answer all my questions concerning Miss Nellie. I will
    tell My Dearest, who it is that is inquiring, tis John Norris, of Columbus-- one of my best
    friends, the first one that raised the shout of triumph this term in Oxford-- he is a happy soul,
    will join the Conference next winter.--</p><p>My case (concerning which I asked your advice) is before
    the preacher & leaders. I have not heard yet the result of my petition but will in a few days and
    let you know.-- I went no farther down the road than Atlanta-- But according to [?] I shall have
    to go down on some business to Grantville about the first of May.-- If there should be anything at
    that time you want from there, or that I can do for you please write me Mollie and you know how
    happy I will be to do it for you. I can get anything for you and send it down from Atlanta to you
    on my return.-- You can write home and have arrangements made for sending you whatever you want and
    I will attend to it as I return.--</p><p>My Dearest Mollie, pray much for your own unworthy Young, that
    he may hold out, be faithful and do the will of God in all things.--</p><p>Pardon this as it is only a
    few lines to warn you that I know not when I can write.-- Write immediately please My Mollie.-- God
    bless you and keep you in the prayer of your own faithful Young forever.--</p></div>
