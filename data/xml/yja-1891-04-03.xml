            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

<salute>Rev. Young J. Allen. D.D.,

My dear Teacher,</salute></opener>

Language<lb/>
            itself cannot express my<lb/> 
            gratitude for the goodness<lb/>
            and kindness that I have<lb/>
            received from you, since I<lb/>
            first entered your College,<lb/>
            in 1884. I was as one<lb/>
            who did not know any-<lb/>
            thing. During the first two<lb/> 
            years I paid little attention<lb/>
            to the religious instructions.<lb/>
            But afterwards the gospel<lb/>
            *shined* into my heart and<lb/> 
            I was converted and<lb/> 
            wanted to be baptized in<lb/>
            the college, but I joined<lb/>
            the Baptist Church because<lb/>
<pb facs="4252.jpg"/>

of my old grandfather who<lb/>
            was the pastor of that <lb/>
            church. I have been teach-<lb/>
            ing school a year in Chin-<lb/>
            Kiang, assisted by the Baptists.<lb/>
            But having a desire to join<lb/>
            your church ever since I<lb/> 
            was first converted, I have<lb/> 
            now made up my mind<lb/>
            to *write* it provided there<lb/>
            are no objections. I have<lb/>
            already sent in my resigna-<lb/>
            tion to the Baptist Church<lb/>
            which has been accepted. I<lb/>
            now feel free, so I hope<lb/>
            that you will kindly<lb/>
            receive me both as a mem-<lb/>
            ber of your church and<lb/> 
            also as a pupil in your<lb/> 
            College that I may prepare<lb/>
            my-self for studying<lb/>
 <pb facs="4253.jpg"/>      

Theology, &#x0026;c.<lb/>

<closer><salute>kindly waiting for your<lb/>
answer.<lb/>

I am<lb/>

Your obedient pupil,<lb/>
</salute>
<signed>Geo H. Bell (alias)<lb/>

<postscript>P.S. Herewith I beg to send<lb/>
you a copy of my<lb/> 
resignation which I sent <lb/>
to the Baptist church<lb/>

<p>G.H.B</p></postscript></div></body>.</text>
