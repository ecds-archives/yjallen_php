<p>	Your kind and 
thoughtful letter of the 24th 
Feb. reached me last week 
and I must acknowledge 
it at once.  I am so glad 
that you allow me to write 
any details or chestnut 
to you.
</p>
<p>	Everything in Oxford 
goes on smoothly.   The 
people have been kind 
to me and I am quite 
satisfied with it.  Boys 
tease me very little and 
are all getting on well.  We 
have some mightly boys at 
our hall and no doubt 
heap good will be done

            <pb facs="4272.jpg"/>

among the irreligious 
boys.  Dr. Candler is earnest 
in preaching, diligent in 
teaching and busy in 
managing the College 
affairs.  We boys all love 
him so much. 
</p>
<p>
Last week Bro. Eakes (our 
pastor in charge) wanted me 
to preach in his country 
church in Shiloh.  I went 
there and preached morn-
ing service for him.  I 
was very well rec'd by 
the people out there.
Afternoon we went to the church 
again and practised some 
songs.  After they found 
out I can sing and play 
on the organ, they wanted 
me to sing some Chinese 

    <pb facs="4273.jpg"/>

songs for them.  I sang 
the old S. S. song "Jesus 
loves me this I know" 
and some of the young 
ladies tried to follow 
the chorus.  They remem-
bered Ya-Su but they 
could not catch up 
E-ngu.
</p>

<p>
Today is cold and 
raining - cold and 
without coal.  Every boy 
is trying to cut the wood 
and burn them instead 
of coal.  Bro. Bailey, out 
Junior boy, made appoint-
ment for me to lecture 
in Monroe todya, but since 
the weather is so bad and 
the rain pours down like 
anything we decided to put 

<pb facs="4274.jpg"/>


up till next Friday.
</p>
<p>
Our students missionary 
band will have a miss-
ionary meeting next week 
in Covington and Bro. 
Yiin and I were appointed 
to lead the meeting in 
our nation continues.  Our 
band is trying to raise up 
some money to help the missionary cause.
</p>

<p>
I have finished my 
B. Ph. Fresh. Medieval 
history, and last week 
was our examination 
and I got 9.9  This week 
we began the Modern 
history. Last Wednesday 
was the first time Dr. 
Candler called on me the 
Soph Bible.  If I can stay 

     <pb facs="4275.jpg"/>

here long enough I wish 
so much to take a regular B. Ph. course or H. B. 
course.  If I take the 
regular course I think 
I can join the Fresh ex-
cept Greek and Latin. 
</p>

<p>
Please thank Mr. Loche 
for his interesting to the 
Wesleyan Adv. in regards 
to both Yiin and me.  If 
I have enough time to spare 
I wish I would write a 
letter to the Advocate too. 
</p>

<p>
Enclosed please hand 
to Chung Grun Kong or his 
brother.
