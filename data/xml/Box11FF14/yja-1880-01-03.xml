            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

<p>I really have not time to write you in answer to your letter of Oct. last but I must send a line, if but a line.  Promptness and punctuality are necessary to correspondence.  I am always grieved and disappointed when my friends do not respond heartily, promptly.</p>
<p>I know you will rejoice at the success which has attended the opening of my new church.  I have been having an old revival time.  Sinners slain, and the work of the Lord made manifest in healings <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" extent="1"/> <unclear reason="illegible">power</unclear>.  It does seem strange <add place="supralinear">to</add> see these heathens <unclear reason="illegible">tremble</unclear> &#x0026; work.  But I must refer you to the Wesleyan for particulars.  What a <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" extent="1"/> work the dear "Georgia Brother"
<pb facs="Allen_11_FF14_002.jpg"/>
has done for our China Mission in giving us this magnificent little church.  You know him full well and I wish I dare tell you his name that you might commune with him.  He is a man whose soul is in sympathy with the Cross of Christ.</p>
<p>What a grand time you had in the mountains.  Perhaps you will be there when this reaches you as I see that more than one has suggested that you would be the right man in the right place if sent there to put some things right, etc.  I was so sad to hear that the great, &#x0026; proud old patriarch had gone at last, and how sad to think that the Bishop was absent.  I could almost <unclear reason="illegible">work</unclear> in sympathy for the blind man, for I dearly love Bishop Pierce.  Pardon this haste there is absolutely no alternative.  God bless you my dear George &#x0026; all your <unclear reason="torn page">family</unclear>.</p>
