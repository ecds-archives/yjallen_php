            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear

<salute><persName ref="#yja">My dear Doctor</persName>:</salute></opener>

<p>	Your letter reached me about the time Bishop Haygood was dying. The funeral services followed, &#x0026; many <unclear>cares</unclear> arising from his death. Shortly afterwards I was taken sick &#x0026; am still confined to my room -- liver enlarged.</p>

	<p>This explains the delay of my answer.</p>

	<p>Before this reaches you Miss Laura will have seen you &#x0026; given you full account of his condition &#x0026; of his departure. It is all very sad, &#x0026; yet it is better that he should go than linger paralyzed for several years. He died as we might fall asleep.</p>

	<p>I have read the pamphlet report &#x0026; have marked some passages for newspaper use. I hope

	    <pb facs="4441.jpg"/>
	    I may be able to help you but have not promise for certain. I have upon me just now several large accounts I am pledged to raise soon.</p>

	<p>There are many signs of returning prosperity in the United States just now. Congress is the worst obstacle in the way of better times. With better financial conditions the Mission Board will surely be able to overcome its debt &#x0026; go forward.</p>

	<p>Your work thrills me. It is not for a day. It will tell for centuries, &#x0026; what that great ice-berg called China melts, as it will, it will found you helped to move it into the Gulf Stream of 

	    <pb facs="4442.jpg"/>
	    Christian warmth.</p>

	<p>Bishop Hendrix is moving to inaugurate the <choice><orig>Corean</orig><reg>Korean</reg></choice> Mission. That will not hurt the work in China.</p>

	<p>I <unclear>believe</unclear> we would have done far more if we had enterprized more work. Our policy has been too timid to arouse enthusiasm, &#x0026;I fear will be until some of the "Conservatives" as they call themselves pass out of influence with the Board.</p>

	<p>When you called for 150 Missionaries the cry ought to have been taken up &#x0026; pressed. That looked like business &#x0026; Christianity in earnest. </p>

	    <pb facs="4443.jpg"/>
	
<p>I find it hard to justify on either the principles of business or the principles of the Gospel the policy we have followed for the last several years.</p>

	<p>C.C. Jarrell and A.M. Pierce will go to the foreign field whenever the church will give the word. And they are two superb young men -- healthy, pious &#x0026; intellectual. Both A.B. men from Emory.</p>

	<p>The college continues to prosper, &#x0026; other young men wish for the foreign field.</p>

	<p>I hope the college work at Shanghai may escape the dangers you fear.</p>
	
	<closer>With love from all to all,<lb/>

	<salute>I am yours affectionately</salute><lb/>
