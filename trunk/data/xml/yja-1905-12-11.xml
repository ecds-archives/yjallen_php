            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

U.S. Minister Plenipotentiary, &#x0026;c&#x0026;c<lb/>

Dear Sir --</salute> </opener><lb/>
<p>At a recent meeting of 
the Board of Trustees of our Soochow University,
I was requested as their Chairman to call your
Excellency's attention to the attitude of the 
Chinese Government toward our Educational In-
stitutions -- In  general the Govt  recognizes
the treaty right of <hi rend="underline">Toleration</hi>, and Chinese are
not debarred from membership in the Christian
Church, but as Christians, Educated in our 
institutions, irrespective of their quali-
fications, they are counted and treated 
as ineligible to any, even the most in-
ferior offices.  Thus showing that the
limited toleration they enjoy has reference
only to their relation to Foreigners, and
by no means implies that this Government

<pb facs="4406.jpg"/>
is disposed to recognize what it is
supposed to grant -- Now  <add place="supralinear">while</add>  <del rend="strikethrough">an</del> we are <add place="supralinear">(averse)</add> <unclear>averse</unclear>
<del rend="strikethrough">not disposed <add place="supralinear">averse</add></del> to recognizing the right 
claimed by the Chinese to inspect our
higher institutions and dictate what their 
curricula shall be, thus attempting to 
substitute a Confucian for a Christian
Curriculum, we would by no means ob-
ject to recognizing any Curriculum the 
Government Schools may adopt, and under-
take in connection with our system 
and Courses of study to prepare men
to stand the requisite examinations for
the respective degrees, if by so doing our
graduates are made equally eligible, ac-
cording to qualification and merit. for 
appointment to office in the Govt. Services.
The point then to which our desire <add rend="supralinear">particularly</add> to call
your attention resolves itself into this.
to <del rend="strikethrough">illegible word</del>

<pb facs="4407.jpg"/>

<hi rend="underline">2nd sheet</hi>
that the measure of <hi rend="underline">toleration</hi> granted
in the treaties is not sufficient to cover
existing conditions, and that unless we 
insist <add place="supralinear">on</add> a wider recognition on the
part of the Govt, we may expect to 
find our schools ignored and their
great value to China depreciated
and lost -- We therefore would urge that 
while China is projecting and adopting
reforms , that no reform is more urgent or
<add place="supralinear">would be more appropriate and</add> <del rend="strikethough">and</del> timely than <del rend="underline">one</del> to grant at once
and for all, entire Religious liberty? It
would be in harmony with the present as-
pirations of the Chinese for a Constitutional 
Govt, and nothing could <del rend="strikethrough">illegible word</del> commend it 
more <add place="supralinear">fully</add> to the Comity-  of nations--
Believing this to be so, we would most 
earnestly commend this subject of Religious Liberty
to your attention and anything you can do toward 
achieving such a reform will greatly relieve our

<pb facs="4408.jpg"/>
Christian work and, <del rend="strikethough">We</del> <add rend="supralinear">we</add> are sure, will not
<del rend="strikethrough">greatly</del> a little influence and improve 
the relations of China with all Christian 
nations.</p>
