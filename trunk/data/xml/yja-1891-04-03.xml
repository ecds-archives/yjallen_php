            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

My dear Teacher,</salute></opener>

<p>Language itself cannot express my gratitude for the goodness and kindness that I have received from you, since I first entered your College, in 1884. I was as one who did not know any thing. During the first two years I paid little attention to the religious instructions. But afterwards the gospel *shined* into my heart and I was converted and wanted to be baptized in the college, but I joinedthe Baptist Church because
<pb facs="4252.jpg"/>

of my old grandfather who was the pastor of that church. I have been teaching school a year in Chin-Kiang, assisted by the Baptists.But having a desire to joinyour church ever since I was first converted, I have now made up my mind to *write* it provided there are no objections. I have already sent in my resignation to the Baptist Church which has been accepted. I now feel free, so I hope that you will kindly receive me both as a member of your church and also as a pupil in your College that I may prepare my-self for studying
