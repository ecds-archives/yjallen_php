            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

And how can that be, does not My Dear One ask? Well, Mollie, I'll tell you how it is.-- I have had the same experiences myself, I had to suffer mortification, disappointment and anguish from the very same causes. I had to be abased, humbled and taught my own weakness, and depravity, my utter helplessness and insufficiency of myself to accomplish any good, just as you have stated in reference to yourself, your own heart; now Dearest, in all these things our experience does not diverge at all, but mutually coincide throughout.--</p></div></body></text>
