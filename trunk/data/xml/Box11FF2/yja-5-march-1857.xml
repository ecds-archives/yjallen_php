                <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF images of each page
                    using either a flatbed scanner. Text pages were captured in color at 400dpi.
                    These digital images were converted to an electronic text file by transcription.
                    The text files produced have been proofread against the original document or a
                    JPEG image of the original. This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                    the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines. For the
                    details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI Guidelines for Best
                    Encoding practices at http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/. Encoders silently
                    replaced em dashes with two dashes. Page numbers and other text such as titles
                    displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear in the
                    original text.</p>

                </opener>
                <p>Last night, <add rend="supralinear">I</add>began a response to your letter and
                    thought then, that perhaps I might be able to write you without much trouble or
                    delay, but I could not finish last night and it so happens now that
                    circumstances over which I can exercise no control, which too were unexpected by
                    me at that time, forbid that I should conclude my letter <hi rend="underline"
                        >now</hi>, if indeed I be able to do it under <hi rend="underline">a
                        week</hi> still in advance. I do exceedingly regret it both on your account
                    as well as mine. I regret that I am compelled to hold you in <pb/><pb
                        facs="Allen_11_ff2_047.jpg"/>such an unpleasant suspense so long and I
                    regret it on my account because I am debarred the privilege of communing with My
                        <hi rend="underline">Dearest One</hi> the very <hi rend="underline"
                        >Idol</hi>of my being and the "life of all my (sweetest) delights." But I
                    must yield in cheerful obedience to the "powers that be"; and to warn you
                    against the <hi rend="underline">anxieties</hi> which my delay might cause in
                    your mind, <del rend="strikethrough">whe</del> if ignorant of the true cause, I
                    send you this hurried line-- <del rend="strikethrough">to</del> hoping that you
                    will pardon (me) and grant me a "<hi rend="underline">week's grace</hi>". I have
                    a few items of news, which by the by, is a rare thing with me, don't you think?
                    that I will give you in addition to what I promised, I had in reserve for the
                    next communication. My Dearest, you will receive this perhaps tomorrow (<del
                        rend="strikethrough">Thursday</del><add rend="supralinear">Friday</add>) and
                    as you failed to answer a few questions in<pb/> my last, I would be <hi
                        rend="underline">more</hi> than glad, yes happy, that you would spend a few
                    minutes with me on Saturday morning and write me a short or long letter as your
                        <hi rend="underline">heart</hi> or feelings might dictate.-- Please now
                    Dearest, do write me a few lines any how. You know how welcome they will be. I
                    will reply just as soon as <hi rend="underline">possible</hi>, yes if it were
                    this very evening.</p>
                <p>Yes Mollie, I know Mr. Hightower of the Sen. Class&#x2014; and by the by he
                    is acquainted with a Miss Kendall of your Sen. Class, perhaps <hi
                        rend="underline">more intimately</hi> than I with him.</p>
                <p>I find out a secret now and then Mollie. Several of our boys have their hearts
                    centered <hi rend="underline">there</hi>. Miss Rylander's <hi rend="underline"
                        >SweetHe--</hi> is one of <add rend="supralinear">my</add> particular
                    friends so is the Cousin of Miss Lundy &amp;c.</p>
                <p>I reserve the balance for the anticipated<pb facs="Allen_11_ff2_048.jpg"/>time
                    when I can fully express myself-- on all these points.--</p>
                <closer>You will please My Dearest, Remember me often, and know that at morn and at
                    noon and night I never fail to remember Thee at the Mercy Seat and every hour in
