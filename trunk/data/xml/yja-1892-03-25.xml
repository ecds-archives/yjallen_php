            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of

                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at

<salute>My dear Doctor;</salute><lb/> 

</opener><lb/>
<p>	Your kind and <lb/>
thoughtful letter of the 24th <lb/>
Feb. reached me last week <lb/>
and I must acknowledge <lb/>
it at once.  I am so glad <lb/>
that you allow me to write <lb/>
any details or chestnut <lb/>
to you.<lb/>
</p><lb/>
<p>	Everything in Oxford <lb/>
goes on smoothly.   The <lb/>
people have been kind <lb/>
to me and I am quite <lb/>
satisfied with it.  Boys <lb/>
tease me very little and <lb/>
are all getting on well.  We <lb/>
have some mightly boys at <lb/>
our hall and no doubt <lb/>
heap good will be done<lb/>
<lb/>
            <pb facs="4273.jpg"/> {Page 2}<lb/>
<lb/>
among the irreligious <lb/>
boys.  Dr. Candler is earnest <lb/>
in preaching, diligent in <lb/>
teaching and busy in <lb/>
managing the College <lb/>
affairs.  We boys all love <lb/>
him so much. <lb/>
</p><lb/>
<p><lb/>
Last week Bro. Eakes (our <lb/>
pastor in charge) wanted me <lb/>
to preach in his country <lb/>
church in Shiloh.  I went <lb/>
there and preached morn-<lb/>
ing service for him.  I <lb/>
was very well rec'd by <lb/>
the people out there.<lb/>
Afternoon we went to the church <lb/>
again and practised some <lb/>
songs.  After they found <lb/>
out I can sing and play <lb/>
on the organ, they wanted <lb/>
me to sing some Chinese <lb/>
<lb/>
    <pb facs="4274.jpg"/> {Page 3}<lb/>
<lb/>
songs for them.  I sang <lb/>
the old S. S. song "Jesus <lb/>
loves me this I know" <lb/>
and some of the young <lb/>
ladies tried to follow <lb/>
the chorus.  They remem-<lb/>
bered Ya-Su but they <lb/>
could not catch up <lb/>
E-ngu.<lb/>
</p><lb/>
<lb/>
<p><lb/>
Today is cold and <lb/>
raining - cold and <lb/>
without coal.  Every boy <lb/>
is trying to cut the wood <lb/>
and burn them instead <lb/>
of coal.  Bro. Bailey, out <lb/>
Junior boy, made appoint-<lb/>
ment for me to lecture <lb/>
in Monroe todya, but since <lb/>
the weather is so bad and <lb/>
the rain pours down like <lb/>
anything we decided to put <lb/>
<lb/>
<pb facs="4275.jpg"/> {Page 4}<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
up till next Friday.<lb/>
</p><lb/>
<p><lb/>
Our students missionary <lb/>
band will have a miss-<lb/>
ionary meeting next week <lb/>
in Covington and Bro. <lb/>
Yiin and I were appointed <lb/>
to lead the meeting in <lb/>
our nation continues.  OUr <lb/>
band is trying to raise up <lb/>
some money to help the miss-<lb/>
ionary cause.<lb/>
</p><lb/>
<lb/>
<p><lb/>
I have finished my <lb/>
B. Ph. Fresh. Medieval <lb/>
history, and last week <lb/>
was our examination <lb/>
and I got 9.9  This week <lb/>
we began the Modern <lb/>
history. Last Wednesday <lb/>
was the first time Dr. <lb/>
Candler called on me the <lb/>
Soph Bible.  If I can stay <lb/>
<lb/>
     <pb facs="4276.jpg"/> {Page 5}<lb/>
<lb/>
here long enough I wish <lb/>
so much to take a regu-<lb/>
lar B. Ph. course or H. B. <lb/>
course.  If I take the <lb/>
regular course I think <lb/>
I can join the Fresh ex-<lb/>
cept Greek and Latin. <lb/>
</p><lb/>
<lb/>
<p><lb/>
Please thank Mr. Loche <lb/>
for his interesting to the <lb/>
Wesleyan Adv. in regards <lb/>
to both Yiin and me.  If <lb/>
I have enough time to spare <lb/>
I wish I would write a <lb/>
letter to the Advocate too. <lb/>
</p><lb/>
<lb/>
<p><lb/>
Enclosed please hand <lb/>
to Chung Grun Kong or his <lb/>
brother.<lb/>
</p><lb/>
<closer><lb/>
<salute>	It is now getting late and <lb/>
I will go to bed.  Good night <lb/>
