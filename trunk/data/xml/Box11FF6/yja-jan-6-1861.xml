                <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF images of each page
                    using either a flatbed scanner. Text pages were captured in color at 400dpi.
                    These digital images were converted to an electronic text file by transcription.
                    The text files produced have been proofread against the original document or a
                    JPEG image of the original. This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                    the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines. For the

                    <salute>My dear Pa &amp; Ma,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I ought to have written you a birth-day letter. I know you will be glad to hear
                    from me any-time, however, so I will write the sooner now as I did not then. <hi
                        rend="underline">I wish you all a happy New Year</hi>.</p>
                <p>We are still in Shanghai; with but little prospect of getting away soon. In
                    company with Brother Lamberth a few weeks ago I visited the place where we were
                    expected to live. It was one year ago one of the largest, most populous and
                    beautiful cities in all China. It is quite as large in extent as N.York City and
                    containd twice as many inhabitants; but it is now almost entirely destroyed,
                    burned up, and very nearly all the people have left. There were forty thousand
                    soldiers there when we were there. On our way back to Shanghai we met a very
                    large rebel army marching directly to the city, with full intent to complete its
                    overthrow and<pb/><pb facs="Allen_11_FF6_002.jpg"/> entire destruction. We met
                    the army in the grand Canal, which is about one hundred feet wide. We were in a
                    small boat and the army had boats. We did not have much apprehensions of danger
                    as they profess and show great respect and kindness to foreigners. When they
                    first perceived our boat, they began to make preparations to capture us. Bro. L
                    and I were sitting on the bow of the boat watching the whole maneuver. When they
                    came quite near us, they soon perceived their mistake- that we were not Chinese
                    but foreigners,- whereupon they cried out to one another "<hi rend="underline"
                        >foreign devils</hi>", "<hi rend="underline">foreign brethren</hi>" had a
                    hearty laugh and passed us without interruption. We stopped along side the bank
                    for two hours hoping they would soon pass, but at the expiration of that time
                    there seemed to be no abatement in progress or <sic>dimminution</sic> in
                    numbers; in other words we concluded there was no end to them and went on. We
                    found them densely crow<add place="supralinear">d</add>ed and rapidly marching
                    in a line for twenty miles. Had we remained stationary where we first met them
                    they could not have<pb/> passed us all that day. The rear camps one night where
                    the front ranks did the night before. In other words the army about measures its
                    full length during one day's march. We had the pleasure, or rather I should say
                    the necessity, of calling on board the General's boat. He informed us that he
                    had upwards of ten thousand boats. We supposed not less than twelve thousand,
                    the very least; upon them we counted from three to twenty seven more; that is,
                    making a reasonable calculation, somewhere between sixty &#x0026; seventy
                    thousand soldiers. Through all this immense, moving mass of boats and men we had
                    to make headway for twenty miles. Would that I had the time and ability to
                    portray to you something of <add place="supralinear">the</add> scene. It cannot
                    well be exaggerated. Glad indeed and thankful too were we when they were all
                    passed. We barely succeeded passing them that <del rend="strikethrough"
                        >they</del> day <add place="supralinear">in time to camp</add>
                    notwithstanding we were both in motion. You may think we travelled slowly; it is
                    true we did. You must however remember that <hi rend="underline">large
                        bodies</hi> move slowly and so do small ones against such fearful<pb
                            facs="Allen_11_FF6_003.jpg"/> odds. All these were bound to the great city
                    of HangChow which we had just two days before left. You can well imagine now,
                    that it is doubtful <del rend="strikethrough">now</del> how long before we leave
                    here if we depend on HangChow for an opening.</p>
                <p>With the above facts before us and in view of a continuance of the same and
                    perhaps worse circumstances in the future; it was concluded, at our last mission
                    meeting, to be best not to bind our hearts and hopes to that one place; but now
                    look out for an open door and a house somewhere else. Bro L and I therefore have
                    under contemplation a visit to Su Chow and Nankin, both held by the rebels at
                    this time, and will perhaps leave here week after next- 15 or 17th of Jan.</p>
                <p>We are very pleasantly situated here; could not be more so at home, but we are
                    anxious to secure a place to work and a home amidst the people.</p>
                <p>There are hundreds of little things I would like to tell you had I time. Things
                    new, strange and heathen. I have seen much that I used to read of and
                    much<pb facs="Allen_11_FF6_004.jpg"/> that's not in books- but little
                    to make one glad and much to make one sad.</p>
                <p>There never was a more distressing time nor a more distressed country than China
                    at present. My heart grew sick and tired of the scenes of desolation and ruin
                    that I saw- but oh! how infinitely worse than what I saw is the reality.
                    Hundreds and thousands, yea hundreds of thousands of people are destitute of
                    house and home and many of them of the necessaries of life- besides, a grievous
                    famine now threatens the whole country and this vicinity in particular. The
                    rebels have devastated the country, leaving but comparatively few people where
                    they have been to make crops and supply the markets, and a flood last fall
                    overwhelmed the rice fields and destroyed <del rend="strikethrough"> >the</del>
                    much of the main dependence of the poor Chinese.</p>
                <p>I hear a drought has cut short the crops at home-- but oh! how happy and well
                    supplied are our people <del rend="strikethrough">at home</del> when compared
                    with these.</p>
                <p>How could we complain if we but know how it was <add place="supralinear"
                    >with</add> thousands and tens of thousands who suffer unpitied and die
                    uncared for unnoticed.</p>

                <p>My dear Pa and Ma, I must now hasten to conclude this letter. I hope you are all
                    quite well. I would like so much to have a letter from you.</p>
                <p>We are now very well indeed. Dollie has altogether recovered. My health never was
                    better. Our Little Mellie is now quite well cheerful and happy. While I write
                    she is sitting by the fire trying to sew. She has nearly all her teeth. Can talk
                    some English and quite as much Chinese. This is our mid-winter now and it is
                    sometimes very cold. The changes are rather sudden and disagreeable here.
                    Remember us to all our friends especially to Sister Mellie &#x0026; family
                    &#x0026; Uncle <unclear>Carlis's</unclear> family. Tell Allen, Gustus and
                    William to write me, if only a short letter. How are Johnie &#x0026; Jimmie</p>
                <p>May God bless you all and finally bring us together again in our Father's house
                    above. My dear Pa and Ma, let us live for heaven. I never expect to see you
                    again on earth below, but Oh! I do hope and pray to meet you again in <hi
                        rend="underline">heaven above</hi>.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Dollie and babie send much love with, Yours very Affectionately,</salute>
