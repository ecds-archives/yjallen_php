            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.

                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear

    <salute>Rev. Y. J. Allen DD<lb/>Dear Teacher</salute>,</opener><lb/>

	<p>Since I wrote you the last one in Yokohama, I had a pleasant trip
	    across the Pacific ocean.  I <choice><sic>arrive</sic><corr>arrived</corr></choice> here last Sunday morning, but I was kept on board until yesterday.  After we arrived in San Francisco, the Custom officer came and took away all our passports.  He let all the Japanese <choice><sic>went</sic><corr>go</corr></choice> away but <choice><sic>keep</sic> <corr>kept</corr></choice> all the Chinese on the steamer.  The next day he came again and examined
	    <pb facs="4255.jpg"/>

us.  He asked me many questions and <add place="supralinear">also</add> took away any introducing letters.  He took Mr. Masters and Dr. Hannon's letters for evidences.  The next day the examiner came again and wrote down all the statement which I have told him and then I signed my name. On the same day (i.e. Tuesday) I wrote a letter to Mr. Masters and so he came down the steamer to see me.  I told him the statement and he went down<add place="supralinear"> to</add> the Customs to see the collector.  Mr. Masters told me to remove my things to his house after I landed yesterday.  I came on shore
	    <pb facs="4256.jpg"/>

and remove any things to Mr. Master's house.  I am now living in the Y.M.C.A. room.  The  native christians (Cantonese) are so kind to me especially the native preacher Mr. Cahn and they <add place="supralinear">all</add> treated me by <sic>term</sic></p>

	<p>I was told that Dr. Hannon is not in this city.  He went to somewhere else on account of his bad health so I will not go &#x0026; see him.  But I will try to go and see Bishop Fitzgerald today.  I hope I will stay here two or three <choice><sic>day</sic><corr>days</corr></choice>and going up to Ga.</p> 
	    
	    <p>Well, as China <del>is</del> will leave here today, I think I must bring my letter to

	        a close and hope to write again when I reached Ga.</p>

	    With best regard<lb/> 
	    Believe me my dear teacher.</salute><lb/>
