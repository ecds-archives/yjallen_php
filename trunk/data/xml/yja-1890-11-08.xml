            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear
                in the original text.</p>

<salute>Rev. Dr Allen<lb/>
My Dear Sir;</salute>
<p>I have the pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of your welcome letter of the 23d Sept. a few days ago.
</p>
<p>Many thanks for the interest you take in my education. As to the choice of the school I shall leave it altogether to your judgment. Any of the Colleges you named will, I presume, suit my purpose. In your own time, please let me know where and how I may proceed for the accomplishment of my object. Having said this much I may only add that were I to consult my own inclinations I would prefer Emory &#x0026; Henry, Va. or Emory, Ga. to others.
</p>
<pb facs="4246.jpg"/>
<p>When I was in <name type="place" reg="Shanghai, China">Shanghai</name>, my chief care was to be out of debt. Once in, since I came here, my fear is that I may have to stop before getting an education. The moment I leave America I shall bid farewell to all facilities and opportunities for a college training. This makes me anxious for taking up some academic studies in a smaller school.
</p>
<salute>Whether my wishes can be realized or not in this respect, I shall always, for the kindesses I owe you, remain
</salute>
<closer>
<salute>Yours gratefully</salute>
