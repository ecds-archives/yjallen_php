            <p>Processing this electronic text file began by creating TIFF
                images of each page using either a flatbed scanner.  Text pages were
                captured in color at 400dpi.  These digital images were converted to
                an electronic text file by transcription.  The text files produced
                have been proofread against the original document or a JPEG image of
                the original.  This proofread text file has then been encoded using
                the recommendations for Level 3 of the TEI in Libraries Guidelines.
                For the details of Level 3 encoding, please see the webpage for TEI
                Guidelines for Best Encoding practices at
                http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/tei/.  Encoders silently replaced em
                dashes with two dashes.  Page numbers and other text such as titles
                displayed in brackets have been added by the encoder and do not appear

                <salute>My Dear Papa,</salute></opener>

<p>I am going to school and am geting along very in my studies, I have altogether 7 studies a day.  
Mama has <choice><sic>boardars</sic></choice> this term and two of them are the old boys.  I am now in the second year subfresh class. 
There are about 60 boys in my class and in the whole College. There are about 250 boys.  I am now <choice><sic>takeing</sic><corr>taking</corr></choice> singing 
lessons. I went to school this summer to Mr. Carney and study Latin.  I am still a little behind in Latin but in all 


<pb facs="4447.jpg"/>
the other studies I am up in.  This summer I stayed in Oxford 2 months and the month I to Newnan to see <choice><sic>Ant</sic><corr>Aunt</corr></choice> Monties 
a while and stayed 1 week there.  I picked cotton for Uncle Sam one day and I picked 60 pounds for him the first 
time.  He says that was pretty well for the first time, then I went to Lagrange and stayed for about 8 days.  
I stayed at Mr. Tuggles the first day and the rest of the time I stayed at the Female college for a <choice><sic>wick</sic><corr>week</corr></choice> and a 
good time with the girls.  There was 30 girls and <choice><sic>ownly</sic><corr>only</corr></choice> 1 boy to stays with there and I got sort of <choice><sic>lounsome</sic><corr>lonesome</corr></choice>.

 
 <pb facs="4448.jpg"/>
This summer while I was at Uncle Sams I went a possum hunting with 2 of Uncles friends and <unclear>Huse</unclear>  went with us also. 
We went about 2 miles from home then one of the dogs barked and one of the negroes said bob has treed one and we went
to the tree he was in it was a great big <choice><sic>Popla</sic><corr>poplar</corr></choice> it happened to be a moonlight and we could see the possum very easy one of the negroes <choice><sic>throughin</sic><corr>throwing</corr></choice> lumps of dirt at him and hit
him on the back and he <choice><sic>hoped</sic><corr>hopped</corr></choice> out and the dog caught it.  


<pb facs="4449.jpg"/>
Give my love to my friends and tell them that I have not
forgotten them yet, how are the old servants getting along with Mellie, I hope that my dog is still living yet does he still watch like he use to do.  Give my love to <choice><sic>Ant</sic><corr>Aunt</corr></choice> sweet and Uncle Fred.  Ask <choice><sic>Ant</sic><corr>Aunt</corr></choice> Sweet to write to me.  
Give my love to <unclear>Mr. Loehr </unclear>and <unclear>Mr. Wrice</unclear>.</p>
